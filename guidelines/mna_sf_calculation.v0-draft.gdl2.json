It was developed to provide a simple, reliable way to screen nutritional status of persons over age 65 and to add a nutrition component to the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. The full MNA® has 18 items and classifies one as normally nourished, at risk for malnutrition, or malnourished. It was well validated in the hospital, community and long term care settings. To save time in screening, Rubenstein et al developed a shortened version, the Mini Nutritional Assessment®-Short Form or MNA®-SF in 2001, and created a 2-step screening process. Six questions with the strongest correlation on the original MNA® comprised the MNA®-SF. The short form was validated in the ambulatory care setting as a quicker way to screen large groups of people and eliminated the need to complete the full MNA® when a person was normally nourished."}}}},"term_bindings":{}}}
